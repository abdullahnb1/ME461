1 - How is encoder working? What is the working principle of encoder?
Potantiometer has noşse in it, it has the analog signal, 

2 - Our pico has 12 bits, that means 2 to the  power of 12 equals 4096,
it means that we can detect 3.3 v / 4096 signal.

3 - If the input condition is repeated and the output is comes close,
it is repeatable, consistant, precise. And also it is giving the actual 
value, it is accurate.

4 - After every measurement, the small error throughout the measurement
is called standard deviation.

5 - There are two types of encoder: Incremental and absolute encoders.
Absolute encoder or potentiometer can tell the absolute position of the
sendor. Wherease incremental sensors sends only the displacement.

6 - 2 assignment: 1 st one is going to be a app. Everything on the PCB.
Only do not use servo motor. Do not use anythşing has inductive load in it.
Because they like to use sharp peaks. If you do not use peak 

7 - Only DC voltage, AD converters, everything should be displayed on pc,
get the menu page, list all the capabilities of the scope, list all the
capabilities of the modern day scope for starting, very usable interface,
voltage range 0-3.3 V, min 2 channel,
