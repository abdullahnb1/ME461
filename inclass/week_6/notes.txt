1 - Presentation about "Sampling Theorem has been made"

2 - On an integrated circuit north of the circuit is marked with a dot or a block. 
It says that left north is 1 and start counting

3 - When a component connected to 5V and connected pin is HIGH, nothing happens. 
But, if it is LOW then it is sinks the current.

4 - When a component connected to 0V and connected pin is LOW, nothing happens. 
But, if it is HIGH then it is sinks the current.

5 - When we wanted to make the circuit conservative, we will use the smallest 
mA of source or sink.

6 - When you press the button and it acts multiple times, it maybe because of the 
debouncing. Basic solution is might be waiting 20 ms.

7 - Watchdog timer, use it, learn it

8 - EEPROM --> bak buna

9 - In logic SET means 1, RESET means 0.

10 - xor, or , and learn them.

11 - Communicate with the pico via wifi. Play your game from your pc and run from 
pico.

12 - 16x32 dot matrix for a screen. The catch is that the game is going to be for 2
players, and 2 player will be collaborating. WASD and arrow keys will be buttons. 
Even buttons not pressed, pico will send the current state and computer screen will
show the current state.
