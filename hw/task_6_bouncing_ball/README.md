# ME461 – Raspberry Pi Pico W Communication Experiments

### MQTT (Mosquitto) • UDP Multicast • WiFi Web Server • Distributed Bouncing Ball Game

This repository contains multiple communication prototypes for Raspberry Pi Pico W boards, developed as part of **ME461 – Mechatronic Components & Instrumentation**.
Each folder represents a distinct communication method between two or more Picos, as well as a distributed multi-screen game project.

# 1. Mosquitto MQTT Communication (`/mosquito`)

These scripts demonstrate reliable Pico-to-Pico communication using MQTT with a Mosquitto broker.

## Included Scripts

### `publisher_subscriber_a.py` & `publisher_subscriber_b.py`

Two Pico scripts used to verify two-way communication.

- Pico A publishes → Pico B receives
- Pico B publishes → Pico A receives

### `publisher.py`

Simple MQTT publisher example.

### `subscriber.py`

Basic MQTT subscriber example.

### `main.py`

A combined experimental script for testing multiple behaviors.

### `micropython-umqtt.simple-1.3.4/`

MicroPython MQTT client library (`umqtt.simple` and `umqtt.robust`).
This folder must be copied to the Pico filesystem.

# 2. UDP Multicasting (`/mosquito/udp_multicasting`)

An early attempt at communication using UDP multicast.

**Note:**MicroPython on Pico W does *not* fully support multicast features such as:

- `inet_aton`
- IGMP membership
- multicast TTL

This code is included only for reference and is not used in the final system.

---

# 3. Web Server Communication (`/web_server`)

Scripts for HTTP communication using Pico W as Access Point or Station.

### Files

- `ap_server.py` – Pico runs a WiFi Access Point and serves an HTML page
- `sta_client.py` – Pico connects to existing WiFi and performs HTTP requests

---

# 4. Distributed Bouncing Ball Game (`/task_6_bouncing_ball`)

A multi-device distributed game in which:

- Picos elect a leader (main physics engine)
- Each Pico sends heartbeat signals
- Multiple OLED screens combine into one large virtual display
- A ball bounces across all screens

Each Pico controls a slice of the screen.
The system handles dynamic Pico online/offline changes automatically.

---

# Required Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico W (one or more)
- SSD1306 OLED display (I2C, 128×64)
- Jumper wires & breadboard
- Wi-Fi network or laptop hotspot
- Laptop running Mosquitto MQTT broker

---

# Pico W → SSD1306 OLED Wiring (I2C)

Your project uses these exact pins:

- SDA → GP10
- SCL → GP11

## Wiring Table

| SSD1306 Pin | Pico W Pin | Notes         |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| VCC         | 3.3V       | Do not use 5V |
| GND         | GND        | Common ground |
| SDA         | GP10       | I2C Data      |
| SCL         | GP11       | I2C Clock     |

# Running MQTT Communication

## 1. Install Mosquitto on your computer (Ubuntu example)

```bash
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
```

## 2. Test the broker

```bash
mosquitto_sub -t test
mosquitto_pub -t test -m "hello"
```

## 3. Flash scripts to Picos

- Flash `publisher_subscriber_a.py` to Pico A
- Flash `publisher_subscriber_b.py` to Pico B
- Set:
  - `MY_ID = 0` for Pico A
  - `MY_ID = 1` for Pico B

## 4. Communication should start

Each Pico should print the other's messages through MQTT.

---

# Running the Distributed Bouncing Ball Game

1. Start your Mosquitto broker
2. Connect all Picos to the same Wi-Fi network
3. Flash the game script to each Pico
4. Assign each Pico a unique `MY_ID`
5. OLED screens together form one large display
6. The ball moves across all screens continuously
7. Leader Pico runs physics; followers only draw
